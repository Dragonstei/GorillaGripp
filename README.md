# GorillaGripp - Werkplaatsproject S1
Custom script to work with the LEGO EV3 Mindstorms - Education set

Documentation found on: https://pybricks.com/ev3-micropython/

## Instructions

When using Visual Studio Code in combination with the EV3 MicroPython extension, make sure
to set the "End of Line Sequence" from CRLF to LF (Windows Line Ending to UNIX Line Ending)

**Git currently handles EOL automatically, need to figure out a way to stop this (keeps changing LF back to CRLF)**
